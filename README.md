# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

In this assignment, we were tasked to build a profile generator for multiple employees (manager, engineer, and intern)

We utilized tests and classes to build our team. The employee was our parent class and our managers, engineers, and interns were our subclasses

We exported shipped modules like "inquirer" and "jest" to have our CLI and class testing run smoothly. 

We then were to create a Command Line Interface utilizing Node.js, prompting the user a series of questions regarding information about the employees. 

In the end, we dynamically created an HTML file with cards showing the information of each employee the user input. 

Below is a video showing the application's functionality:
